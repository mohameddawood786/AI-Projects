        "The **Wumpus World** is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and is often used as a benchmark for testing knowledge representation and reasoning systems. The problem is based on a world containing a wumpus (a mythical creature similar to a dragon), pits, gold, and a player (an agent) who can navigate through the world. The agent's goal is to find the gold and return to the starting position while avoiding the wumpus and falling into pits.\n",

        "**Environment:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment is represented as a grid or a cave with rooms.\n",
        "Each room can be in one of several states: empty, contains the wumpus, contains a pit, contains gold, or is the starting position of the player.\n",

        "Wumpus: A dangerous creature that can kill the player if the player enters the room containing the wumpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pits: Pits are dangerous holes in the ground, and falling into a pit leads to the player's death.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gold: The goal of the agent is to find the gold and return to the starting position with the gold.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Percepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent perceives its immediate surroundings, including whether there is a breeze (indicating a pit nearby), a stench (indicating the wumpus nearby), or a glitter (indicating gold).\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent also receives feedback when it performs an action, such as a scream (indicating the wumpus has been killed) or a bump (indicating the agent has hit a wall).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Actions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Move: The agent can move to an adjacent room.\n",
        "\n",
        "Turn: The agent can turn left or right.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grab: The agent can pick up gold if it is in the same room.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shoot: The agent can shoot an arrow in a direction to kill the wumpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Climb: The agent can climb out of the cave, indicating that it wants to end the game.\n",
